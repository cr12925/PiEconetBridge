Prerequisites
-------------

The system will require:
	- Raspberry Pi 4B (anything less and timing issues mean it won't work
          at the moment, but I am working on it!)
	- No other GPIO usage on the system
	- The hardware (see Hardware.pdf), which in turn requires a Master 128
          Econet board
	- Your installation of PiOS having the kernel headers installed (see
          below)
	- A pre-existing functioning Econet (with clock) with a spare station
          port to connect to the hardware


WARNING - NO, REALLY, YOU SHOULD READ THIS!
-------------------------------------------

I was once told that the difference between a professional musician and an the
amateur is that the amateur practices until he gets the piece right; the
professional practices until the piece simply will not go wrong.

On any view, by analogy, this is amateur code.

This is work which I have produced with no real experience of either
electronics, the 68B54 ADLC, or kernel module programming.

In particular, the following undesirable characteristics of this system should
be noted. These are typically owing to a lack of talent on my part. I well
understand the desirability of fixing them all. If anyone with more talent
than me wishes to have a go, I would be genuinely very happy. Notwithstanding
the list below, I am a huge fan of doing things the 'proper' way. It is a
matter of regret that I have not managed to do so. In particular:

	- It reads and writes directly from the GPIO hardware instead of using
	  the kernel routines. I accept this renders it less portable even
	  within Raspberry Pi systems, though at least the Peripheral Base
	  address is in a #define!

	- It probably does not handle AUN ACK and NAK quite the way it should.

	- It does not use ..._probe to load the module when it probably ought
	  to.

	- It does not use the Device Tree when it really should. I can only say
	  that I tried for a very long time to work out how to do that from a
	  standing start, and I got a little way but became lost. I would be
	  very pleased if anyone can explain.

Whilst the bridge appears to be relatively reliable, e.g. for a realy BBC
accessing a file or print server on an emulator (e.g. BeebEm), and vice versa,
there are some wrinkles which periodically crop up:

	- Sometimes the AUN state machine in the kernel gets out of step -
	  probably because of a lost packet. The solution is to quit the bridge
	  in userspace (see below) and remove & reinsert the kernel module.

	- I have had a couple of occasions where an Acorn fileserver has
	  changed all directory permissions to "DL/" when using the bridge, and
	  even creates new directories with that permission, and will not allow
	  a change back to DWR/ for example. I do not know whether this is
	  something in the bridge, or something in the Level 3 FS.

	- Sometimes the kernel module gets stuck unable to transmit. Solution
	  as for the AUN state machine.

It is some time since I saw a kernel crash with this module, but you should be
alive to the prospect that it might happen. If you use this on a production
system that's doing something else, you have been warned!

Whilst almost everything I have tried from BeebEm seems to work with a real
fileserver, there appears to be one exception: If I run up BeebEm as a Master
128 and try to *SRLOAD a sideways ROM image from a real BBC fileserver, the
BeebEm end just stops. I can *LOAD the same file elsewhere into the BeebEm's
emulated RAM, just not *SRLOAD into sideways RAM. At present I take the view
this may well be a BeebEm bug, but I don't know. (Update: Actually, *real* 
BBC Masters seem to struggle to *SRLOAD from an Econet fileserver - both them
and BeebEm seem to get gibberish (packets full of the same byte) delivered in
the data burst from the server. It is worth noting that *SRLOAD does a file
open (FS operation 6) rather than *LOAD (FS operation 2). That is almost
certainly because the NFS has to get swapped out so that the CPU can write
to &8000 upwards in Sideways RAM so that it cannot simply plonk the data 
from the server straight into wherever it is going.

INSTALLATION
------------

1. Install your kernel headers. On PiOS that requires the following (prepended
   by 'sudo ' if you are not root):

	sudo apt install raspberrypi-kernel-headers

2. Get the distribution of the bridge code. It comes in three main sections:
   kernel module, utilities, configuration

3. Build the kernel module

	cd module
	make

4. Build the utilities

	cd utilities
	make

5. Edit the configuration file (sample in config/econet.cfg) and put it in
   /etc/econet-gpio/econet.cfg

   Note: If you want to put it elsewhere that's fine - just use the '-c' option
   when running econet-bridge (see below).

   (Neither the kernel module nor the other utilities use the configuration
   file.)

LOADING THE KERNEL MODULE
-------------------------

	cd module
	sudo insmod ./econet-gpio.ko

If you are not running the utilities are root, you should change the
permissions on the newly arrived /dev/econet-gpio, e.g.:

	sudo chmod a+rw /dev/econet-gpio

If you want to choose the group / permissions for the /dev/econet-gpio device,
you can put a file such as that in the 'udev' directory into /etc/udev/rules.d

Obviously if you want to use the group 'econet' as set out in the example file,
then you will need to create it as root with something like

	groupadd econet

And then add the pi user to it with something like

	usermod -a -G econet pi

You should then find that the pi user can run the utilities (rather than root)
but can still talk to the Econet device.

A WORD ON THE KERNEL MODULE
---------------------------

The kernel module does two things:

	- First, it transmits and receives packets through the ADLC.
	- Second, it implements a state machine which does the 4-way handshake
	  and converts data packets off the wire into AUN-style packets.
	  (Internally, and when communicating with the utilities, it adds an
	  extra four bytes on the start of each packet which match those on an
	  Econet frame to make it easier to work out where a packet is going,
	  viz.  destination station, destination network, source station,
	  source network (in that order).
	
	  Similarly, any packet delivered to the kernel module when it is in
	  AUN mode must have those four extra bytes on it.

The AUN (4-way-handshake) mode is enabled when a 'station set' is delivered to
the kernel module. The station set map tells the module which stations it
should handshake for, or otherwise capture traffic for (e.g. immediates, broadcasts). Only stations which appear in the map (and there are macros to put
stations in the map) will have their traffic forwarded to userspace when in AUN
mode.

If no station map is put into the kernel module after a reload or reset, the
module will remain in non-AUN mode. In that mode, it captures all packets off
the wire, and does *no* 4-way handshake. It simply delivers raw packets through
/dev/econet-gpio to userspace. This mode is not useful practically, but
provides a means of doing network monitoring. Thus the 'econet-monitor'
utilities does not upload a station map, so that the module remains in 'raw'
mode.

The other thing to appreciate is that because a reply to an immediate query on
the hardware econet has to be provided faster than it possibly could be if the
query were sent out over AUN/UDP, a reply collected, and then delivered to the
wire, the kernel module does the immediate replies for 'distant' and 'local'
stations (as to which see below: they're the ones which are not physically
attached to the Econet wire itself). It responds only to a selection. In fact,
in AUN only 'Machine Peek' is implemented in the real world. However, the
kernel module will respond to a MachinePeek with machine type &EEEE (unusued
in the current list) and version 0.1. It will 'sink' continues and halts by
acknowledging them on the wire, but will ignore all other types of immediate
(e.g. memory peek, memory poke, JSR, User subroutine call etc.).

Thus if, on a real BBC on the Econet, you run a BASIC programme which does a
Machine Peek to an AUN station elsewhere, you will (falsely) be told is it
machine type &EEEE running version 0.1 of the network software. In the future,
it may be possible to make the bridge code in userspace collect all the Machine
Peek responses from stations it knows about, and feed them to the kernel module 
to respond by proxy. It is probably unnecessary, and I haven't done it yet.

TESTING - HARDWARE
------------------

If, like me, you've built the hardware on a breadbaord, you should probably
test it before trying to use it. 

There is a utility 'econet-test' which puts the hardware through a test
routine whose results will require an oscilloscope to see. Essentially it
toggles the various address, control and data lines onto the 68B54 ADLC.

To use it, you must first load the kernel module since the kernel module does
the heavy lifting in this regard. See above.

To run the tests:

	cd utilities
	./econet-test

You will see a series of prompts which tell you which lines have been set and
in what way so that they can be checked with the scope. Press return or some
other key after each one to move to the next.

It is *not* recommended you do this with the Econet actually connected to the
module until the very last step.

The last stage is that the test harness will repeatedly use a kernel ioctl()
to send a test packet onto the Econet. You will therefore need to put your
scope on the Data+ and Ground pins on the Econet connector itself to see if the 
packet is transmitted.

Note you will need a clock - the chip will not transmit otherwise.

The test packet is a 'machine peek' immediate query from 0.254 to 0.1. If
station 0.1 is alive on your particular network, it should reply and you should
see two packets in quick succession on the scope. If not, you should just see
one (the test packet itself). 

This last test phase repeats until you press Q and then Enter (case sensitive)
so that you can test repeated transmissions.

If there is a problem, watching the kernel ring buffer (dmesg -we) may give you
a clue why.

THE UTILITIES
-------------

These run from simple to more complex. Each responds to -h on the command line
to give you help.

econet-monitor
--------------

First, econet-monitor. This reads /dec/econet-gpio with the kernel module in
raw mode and simply dumps every packet it sees.

You should see streams of packets (on an active network) which will include all
four packets (separately) of the four-way handshakes. This utilities does *not*
glue them together into one line like Acorn's own NETMON. You literally see
what's on the wire.

The output is verbose by default. You can get a one-line-per-packet (ish)
output by specifying '-b' (brief) on the command line.

One easy way to see some traffic is to run the monitor on a live econet and
press BREAK on a real BBC with the network software loaded. Certainly on a 
Master (which is all I have), the ANFS will send 9 bridge queries out. These
are short broadcasts whose packet data includes the word 'BRIDGE' and you
should see them appear on the monitor screen.

econet-imm
----------

This utility performs various sorts of 'immediate' queries on the econet. It
leaves the kernel in raw mode, sends the query and reads the next packet off
the wire and (save for the continue and halt operations) tells you what was in
it.  

It implements the following operations: Halt, Continue, Machine Peek, Memory
Peek.

In every case you *must* provide a source and destination station number. They
will both be treated as being on net 0 for the purposes of this utility, so
only local stations can be queried (i.e. not those over traditional Econet
bridges). Obviously your own source station number should not already be in
use on the network.

Examples (but see help for detail) with example output:

Send machine peek to station 1 from station 250

$ ./econet-imm -s 1 -d 250 -m
Station reports being a BBC Master 128 OS 3, NFS version 4.25.
$

Send HALT to station 1 from station 250

$ ./econet-imm -s 1 -d 250 -j
$

Send CONTINUE to station 1 from station 250

$ ./econet-imm -s  1 -d 250 -c
$

Send memory peak to station 1 from station 250 for addresses &2000 to &21FF

$ ./econet-imm -s 1 -d 250 -p -q 2000 -r 21FF

Note the first four bytes at &2000, which were put there on the real BBC with
station number 1 with the following BASIC comment:

!&2000=&12345678

econet-bridge
-------------

This is the main bridge code, though it is relatively simple. It uses a
configuration file which tells it about three key types of station: Wire (on
the hardware Econet), Distant (AUN stations accessible over IP) and Local
(emulated within the bridge code itself).

First, the config file. The documentation is contained in comments in the
sample. Please read it.

The bridge code looks for the config file in /etc/econet-gpio/econet.cfg by
default, but the -c switch allows you to specify an alternative.

Notes on each type of configuration line:

N n
---

This sets the network number of the local wire Econet which the bridge will
(when the Bridge Query code is finished) be announced to other bridges. If you
don't have this, the bridge won't deal with bridge queries. This will not stop
it bridging network 0 (your local Econet) to AUN stations in network 0.

W n s p
-------

This creates an AUN listener on port p (on each IP address available on your
bridge machine) for host n.s on your local hardware Econet wire. (Note, because
you may have an Acorn bridge to another wired Econet, you can specify a network
other than 0.)

You must:

- Have one such entry for every station on your local Econet which needs to
  speak to the AUN world.
- Use different port numbers for each such entry. E.g. 32768, 32769, etc.

A n s host p
------------

This tells the bridge that AUN host n.s is available on host 'host' (can be DNS
name or IP address) port p.

The bridge will ONLY bridge to hosts you have told it about in this way.

P n s p printer
---------------

The bridge will accept print jobs with a locally emulated print server on host
n.s port p. It will spool the output provided by the host (which can be another
AUN host as well as a real BBC on the Econet wire) into a temporary file, and
when completed it will despatch it using 'lp' to the printer named 'printer'.
By editing the header file include/econet-pserv.h you can alter the command
line format which is used and, if you wish, use an entirely different printing
command. Unfortunately, at present, there is one command per bridge - so all
virutalized print servers use the same command. I suppose it would be possible
to alter the configuration format simply to specify the command to be used on a
per-server basis.

Running the bridge
------------------

As long as the device has been made world writeable or is accessible by your
current user (e.g. by using the udev configuration and putting the device into
a group of which you are a member) (see above) you should be able to run the
bridge from a non-privileged user as follows:

$ ./econet-bridge

It will produce little output in this mode, save for errors.

The -h command line switch will give you help as to other things you can do. 

-c <path> : Use alternative config.
-d        : Produce packets on stderr as they come and go. These will be
	    AUN-type (i.e. not raw off the wire), post 4-way h/shake.
-b        : When specified with -d, produces abbreviated (~ 1 line per packet)
	    output.
-s        : Dump a summary of the config file before bridging - useful for
	    checking the config has been read.
-q        : Don't do bridge query responses (but the present version doesn't
	    anyway, so this achieves nothing).

EXAMPLE CONFIG & USAGE
----------------------

Suppose you have live stations 1 & 2 on the Econet, and a fileserver on an AUN
machine with IP 5.6.7.8 on port 32768.

Let us imagine the server is running BeebEm. Let us imagine that the Raspberry
Pi running the bridge has IP address 1.2.3.4.

Note that BeebEm MUST be in AUN mode and have SINGLESOCKET set to 1 (these are
default settings as I understand it).

The bridge configuration would be:
W 0 1 32768
W 0 2 32769
A 0 254 5.6.7.8 32768

The tail end of the BeebEm econet.cfg file would read thus:

0 1 1.2.3.4 32768           <--- Matches the port number on 'W 0 1 ...' above
0 2 1.2.3.4 32769           <--- Ditto W 0 2
0 254 5.6.7.8 32768

Make sure your BeebEm configuration includes an NFS ROM of some kind and Econet
is enabled in the options. Make sure BeebEm wakes up and doesn't complain about
not being able to find an Econet address.

Start up, e.g., a Level 3 fileserver in BeebEm.

Next, load the kernel module on the Raspberry Pi (see above).

Then run the bridge as above.

You should find your real BBC can log into the BeebEm Fileserver.

The reverse also works - logging into a real BBC fileserver (or potentially SJ
Research, but I don't have one) from BeebEm.

TO DO
-----

- Implement device tree so that the GPIO pins are defined outside the code
- Use better routines to access GPIOs in kernel
- Make the kernel module use ..._probe instead of ..._init
- Implement fileserver in the bridge code (for the present, aund might be
   usable separately - not tried it)
- Fix potential bug where the kernel module gets stuck in a non-IDLE AUN state.
  Probably just need a timeout somewhere.
- Add ability for bridge to use a single IP:port combination to send whole
  networks over, with network number translation, so that individual remote
  stations need not be inidivually configured.

THE END
-------

Enjoy!

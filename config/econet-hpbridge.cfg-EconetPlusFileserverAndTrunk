WIRE NET 1 ON DEVICE /dev/econet-gpio
FILESERVER ON 1.254 PATH /home/pi/econetfs
TRUNK ON PORT 9000 TO myfriend.econet.org:9500

# Filtering examples
# Support myfriend advertises network 1, and the bridge will automatically
# drop that because net 1 is defined as a Wire above.
# But suppose we have a network 2 which is dynamic stations and he's
# advertising that as well. We want to talk to his machines on HIS net 2
# but we already have one. We translate his net 2 to net 3 locally:
# 
# TRUNK PORT 9000 XLATE DISTANT NET 2 TO LOCAL NET 3
#
# Now suppose we don't want to advertise our net 2 to him:
# 
# BRIDGE DROP NET 2 OUTBOUND ON TRUNK PORT 9000
# 
# Now support he's also got a net 6 and we don't like them and don't want
# to talk to them:
#
# BRIDGE DROP NET 6 INBOUND ON TRUNK PORT 9000
# 
# Now suppose we have a secret network 4 that we don't want to advertise
# to myfriend at all, so his bridge will never think to send traffic for it:
# 
# BRIDGE DROP NET 4 OUTBOUND ON TRUNK PORT 9000
#
# (Note: if we had a second trunk to another friend, the above will only
# filter to 'myfriend.econet.org'. Our other mate will get advertisements.
# Also this command will not prevent advertisements to Acorn/SJ bridges on
# an Econet wire.
# 
# You can prevent advertisement to Econet wire bridges (and indeed prevent
# reception of adverts from them) by replaceing 'ON TRUNK PORT x' with
# 'ON WIRE NET y'.
#
# Now suppose we have a private fileserver and we're happy for myfriend
# to talk to everything we have except that fileserver. Say it's at 1.200:
#
# BRIDGE ALLOW TRAFFIC BETWEEN 1.* and 1.200
# BRIDGE ALLOW TRAFFIC BETWEEN 2.* and 1.200
# BRIDGE DROP TRAFFIC BETWEEN *.* AND 1.200
#
# (Note this actually drops everything except 1.* & 2.* to 1.200 - including
# traffic from other trunks we might be more amenable to - but you can always
# specifically allow their traffic too.)

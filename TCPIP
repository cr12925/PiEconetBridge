Operating the TCP/IP gateway on the Pi Econet Bridge
----------------------------------------------------

First, decide on an IP subnet to be used on your Econet.

e.g. 192.168.0.0/24

Whilst it is not essential to do so, it makes sense to 
use the station numbers as host numbers in that subnet.

E.g. 192.168.0.1 is station 1 on the network, etc.

You could use a bigger subnet if you have bridged nets.
E.g. you could use 172.16.0.0/16 and your Econet
machines could be numbered 172.16.n.s where n is the
network number and s is the station number.

You will first have to set up an IP tunnel interface on
your Pi Bridge. This requires root privileges or 'sudo'.

e.g.

ip tuntap add dev tun0 mode tun

(You can use a different tunX device if you want.)

Then give it an IP address which will match the Econet
station number you are going to run the IP gateway on.

Here, I my gateway will be station 0.252.

NOTE that you cannot run any other bridge services on
the same station you are using for an IP gateway.

In my examples above, the IP address for the tun0 
interface will be either:

192.168.0.252
OR
172.16.0.252

The relevant commands will therefore be (root also
required):

ip address add 192.168.0.252/24 dev tun0
OR
ip address add 172.16.0.252/24 dev tun0

You should now find that an extra route has appeared
in your bridge's IP routing table if you use 'ip route'.
The new route will match the subnet you have just assigned
to the tun0 interface.

Now configure your bridge. Add a line which looks like this
to the config:

UNIX 0 252 32768 /tmp/econet-pipe.0.252

The choice of path at the end is yours, but it will help
if you give an indication of which station it is.

*** The 32768 is a port number which must be unique 
    among all the others in use, just as with normal use
    of the bridge. 

    If the config won't work with a port number included,
    you have an old version of the bridge - just omit the
    port number. All it means is that AUN stations cannot
    talk to the piped station.
***

The 0 & 252 are the network and station number of the
IP gateway.

Then turn on IP routing.

To do that permanently, uncomment the following line in 
/etc/sysctl.conf and reboot:
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1

To do it temporarily, do the following as root:
sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

Then run the gateway itself.

econet-ipgw -p /tmp/econet-pipe.0.252 -t tun0 -i 192.168.0.252/24
OR
econet-ipgw -p /tmp/econet-pipe.0.252 -t tun0 -i 172.16.0.252/16

** NB: The IP address on the command line MUST match the 
   interface address of tun0.

Follow the instructions for the TCP/IP ROM and put a wired
station on an IP address which is within the subnet above,
but which is NOT the same as the one you've put on the bridge.

A sensible first test is to try and telnet to your Bridge
by telnet-ting to the IP address assigned to tun0.

Next, set up some NAT so that your Econet IP network is hidden
behind the bridge (if you want - otherwise you'll have to make
sure you route the 192.168.0.0/24 or 172.16.0.0/16 subnet to
one of the bridge's other IP interfaces).

You should find that something like this will do the trick:

sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.0.0/24 -j MASQUERADE

You should now find that if you follow PB's instructions, you
can TELNET (or TELAPI) to hosts in the wider Internet-world.

Enjoy!

Some common problems and solutions
----------------------------------

1. A BeebEm station cannot communicate with a wired Econet station, 
   or an Econet station cannot communicate with the Pi Fileserver

   Usually this is because the relevant Econet station has not been
   defined properly in the configuration with a 'W' or 'WIRE' directive.

   If the station is not defined at all, then these symptoms will occur.

   If the station is on the local network, define it on network 0, not
   the network number you are using for the local wire.


2. I can log into the PiFS from a wired station, but cannot load files
   of any significant length.

   This is almost invariably caused by one of the following three
   issues:

   a) Lack of termination causing the Econet to be unstable. Check 
      termination carefully and ensure it is at either end of the line.

   b) Clock incorrectly set. Try setting the clock to a period of 5us and
      a mark of 1us to see if this is the issue. Clocks which are much
      faster (such as may be tolerated by Archimedes-class machines)
      are unlikely to work with the Pi Econet hardware.

      Note that clocks are set with period/mark, not mark/space, so
      the period time *includes* the mark time. Thus 5/1 will have
      4us of space time, and 1us of mark.

      *Some* clock hardware has been found to have the DIP switches
      mounted the wrong way around so as to invert either the mark or
      period time configuration. If everything else looks right, this
      may be worth considering.

   c) Dodgy Econet cables. Try a fresh cable on each of the BBC and the
      Pi Bridge.

(More to come as things arise.)

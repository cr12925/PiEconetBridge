***** Installation complete.

***** Please read docs/RELEASE-v2.1 for what is new in this version.

***** If you are using version 1 hardware, please ensure you have:

	a) Not installed the desktop
	b) Included the following lines in your /boot/config.txt and rebooted

	   arm_freq=1000
	   force_turbo=1

	   (Note that on some Pi OSes the file is in /boot/firmware/config.txt
	   See the README!)

***** The Econet library utilities are not included. However they can be found in 
      various places, such as distributed with BeebEm for Windows on the Level 3
      disc (from which they can be copied to the Pi FS with CopyFiles or your
      preferred copier). Alternatively, you can copy the MDFS libraries (there
      is an 8-bit one and a 32-bit one) which can also be found for download.

***** The Pi FS in this version has a number of extensions beyond Level 3,
      including some which are Pi FS specific - for example canonicalisation
      of filenames, and control over the bridge itself. A sample utility
      called PIFSTOOL will have been copied into :PIBRIDGE-00.$.SYSTEM.PIFSTOOL
      on fresh installs, and any installation which has that disc unrenamed.

      If you have renamed your disc 0 (or moved it to be somewhere else)
      then you will need to copy FS/PIFSTOOL to your chosen location. It is
      in BBC BASIC, so you don't need to set load/execute when you copy it.


Enjoy!

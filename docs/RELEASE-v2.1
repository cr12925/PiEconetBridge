RELEASE NOTES FOR V2.1 
----------------------

- Fileserver updates

  - supports long filenames - but will cause display problems for certain
    client machines depending on which FSOps the client uses

  - defaults to file handles with only 1 bit set for compatibility with NFS 3.
    Previous behaviour can be re-enabled if you are not using NFS 3 with
    *NETCONF (see below).

  - Changing a password to something in quotes now works properly

  - Allows a system user to change another user's password with *SETPASS (see
    below)

  - *RENAME now works if the fileserver storage area is mounted on an NFS
    share.

  - Translates '/' in Acorn filenames to '.' in the underlying filesystem


- Kernel updates

  - Kernel module and the bridge supports all the immediate operations which in
    fact use a 4-way handshake (e.g. OSPROC, USRPROC, JSR).

  - Kernel now supports 64 bit operations, and uses the Linux kernel's own calls
    for accessing GPIO Clock and PWM function (for the ADLC clock and Network
    clock respectively). It continues to write directly to the GPIO hardware for
    speed, having attempted to use the official calls for that purpose without
    success.

- Core bridge functionality

  - The original userspace bridge utility has been removed. The HPB is now
    stable and has far better functionality.

  - Bridge now has pool address translation enabled to facilitate trunking of a
    significantly larger number of networks together where most stations are
    clients rather than servers


Roadmap to v2.2 
---------------

- Possible kernel change so that 4-way handshakes do not complete with a final
  ACK from the bridge until it has had an ACK from the distant machine. This
  will generate 'Net error' at the local site if the distant machine is not
  there, rather than 'Not listening', but the latter cannot be generated without
  collecting the data phase of the 4-way handshake, which is needed to build the
  AUN type packets used for AUN stations / trunks.

- Fix displayed directory privileges when the FS is in 'Acorn Directory' mode
  (i.e. display 'D/' or 'DL/' only instead of the full privileges.

- Fix a bug in *NEWUSER if the user's directory already exists.

- Improve MDFS password file functionality, hopefully including writing to it.

- Move to a threaded fileserver

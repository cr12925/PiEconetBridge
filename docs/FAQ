This document is very limited and not intended to replace the README, which
you should read.

1. I have upgraded to v2.1. Why are my permissions different?

   v2.1 has different default permissions, but they should not affect existing
   files. If you had files which were put in the operating system's own 
   filing system, or which for some reason did not have Pi FS permission
   settings, then the permissions you see may have altered.

   You can cure any such problems by manually setting permissions,
   e.g. with *ACCESS on an 8-bit machine, or using the GUI on 
   RISC OS.


2. I am trying to copy a file from the Pi FS to my RISC machine
   and I keep getting 'No Reply' errors.

   This will sound bizarre, but your network termination is probably
   wonky. In testing, this symptom was experienced and all manner
   of things were tried. What cured it was a terminator. That was so
   even though transfers from (e.g.) a Level 4 server on an A3000 on
   the same Econet hub as the Pi worked fine. Transfers from a Level 3
   on the same hub failed - until we added the termination. (That's
   termination *in addition* to the termination being switched on
   on the Pi's HAT.)

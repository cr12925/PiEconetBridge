/* The following defines are based on a GPIO BCM 4 clock speed of 550kHz */
/* There is a special fast bus write routine which has none of the delay of the slow one
 * whose purpose is to write data on the bus when it is going in the TX FIFO. The
 * slower routine is fine for writing to registers, because it doesn't matter if the chip
 * reads those multiple times. However, if it reads the TX FIFO multiple times then
 * unsurprisingly it transmits multiple copies of the same byte onto the wire, which is
 * unhelpful. However, even udelay(1) is too long to hold /CS low, and no udelay at all
 * is too short. On Linux ARM, there appears to be no ndelay(). So there is a loop
 * which uses asm("") to stop the compiler optimizing it out. This is the number of times
 * a for(;;) loop  'calls' asm("") to create the right delay.
 *
 * I am well aware that this is a total fiddle. The value will need to be less on slower
 * machines, probably more on faster machines. I developed on a 3B+.
 *
 * No postcards or other communications about how bad this is, *please*. */
